Write a blog on the diffrence between document and window objects

Window:
The window is the  global object in the web browser environment.
The window object represents an open window in a browser.
The window object methods are used to retrieve the information from the browser window through its methods.
Example: alert, confirm, prompt, open, close, focus, blur, postMessage, scrollTo, scrollBy, resizeTo, and resizeBy, 





Document:
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document. 
The screen,it contains properties about the user's display. The document is where the DOM is.
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object. 
The document object is the root node of the HTML document. 
we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page.
Syntax:
document.property_name;
